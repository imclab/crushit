# CrushIt

Ok here is the deal, I am currently developing a JavaScript intensive application <https://github.com/qawemlilo/nodebooks> and my front-end code is organised into modules of many different javaScript files. I wrote CrushIt so that I can easily compile and compress all scripts into one file that I can use in production without messing up my local development structure. 


# Install (npm)
```
npm install -g crushit
```

# CLI Usage
```
crushit -s [ website(url) ]

Note: does not compile any file name that has a substring of 'modernizr'. 
Modernizr should be left alone in the header section of an html document.
```


# To Do

- Add css support
- Write better docs
- Add login options to scrap logged view
